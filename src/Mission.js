    <p>Determined to make the first mass-distribution record in full 4D as
well as to do the first transition from analogue recording to 4D mixing
and processing.</p>

      But What IS this "spatial sound" you speak of?

Without getting into specifics, spatial sound is a way of projecting
sound that mimics a hologram more closely than a traditional sound-
projecting platform. This has the advantage of being able to
artificially simulate reverb environments as well as to create "objects"
that feel as if they are physically  there, unlike the currently dominant
platforms that can only create a general sense of echolocation. This
opens artists of all kinds up to the use of space itself as a canvas to
create with.</p>

      Paul Oomen is the head of development at 4DSound, as well as the Head of the
Spatial Sound Institute. He is an accomplished composer having had his
arrangements performed by the Amsterdam Philharmonic on a 4D system and has
recently been given the honor of a TEDx talk. His current focus is expansion into the
American Market and to make a partnership to properly commercialize his
technology.

There was another problem I had with traditional record labels: their
inability to keep up with the technological changes the world of
sound engineering has been able to produce in the digital era.
Namely Spatial Sound. Now, I had the idea for spatial sound back in
high school, but never had the research materials or programming
knowledge to make it happen. Naturally, I was ecstatic when I found
there was a firm that was already bringing "my" ideas to life. I was</p>

    <h2>Further Problems With Today's Labels (as if that isn't bad
enough...)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Have thus far been unable to cope with the age of streaming and
    free music on YouTube even with their own streaming-based labels
    </li>
      <li> Usually use outlets like Spotify and ITunes that are low-dollar for
    the artists that allow them to exist</li>
      <li>Always reserve final masters to artists' hard work, allowing them to
    "walk all over" songs and albums </li>
      <li>Do very little to properly promote up-and-coming artists that do not
    have sponsorship of some kind </li>
      <li>Cannot efficiently accommodate developments in sound
    technology because of their models and the lack of ability to
    use a proprietary sound medium, thus hindering their capability to
    exploit the VR market and its' connection to music</li>

      <li>Cannot efficiently become data-based companies or companies
    that adopt to IP licensing models of income to support artists</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> What Does Mobius Bring to the Table?</h2>
    <h3>Merchandising:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pro Audio division that handles performance systems, venue
    installations and equipment such as monitors, mixboards, etc.</li>

      <li>Consumer Audio division focusing on home theater sytems, VR
    headsets, headphones, soundboxes, etc.</li>

      <li>Software division focusing on data science, software publishing,
    engine building and updating products.</li>

      <h6>The Pro Audio market is worth 4BN at 4.9% CAGR*</h6>
      <h6>The Consumer Audio market is worth 16BN at 23.9% CAGR*</h6>
      <h6>Values based on a 2016-2020 calculation*</h6>
    </ul>

    <h3>Streaming-Based Label:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses freemiums to advertise music and drive music discovery;
    users can listen to a song for free one time unless it comes on one
    of our artist-curated internet radio or XM radio stations. After that,
    they have to pay for it or pay for the album at a $ .75 per song
    "bulk discount" of the original song price of $1 to encourage
    people to listen to the full album at least once and to drive up artist
    sales. This balances the values of musicians with the values of
    today's listener effectively.</li>

      <li>Artists keep 50% of ad revenue they generate on web app/console
    app/mobile app, 90% of all online sales, 70% of all brick-and-
    mortar sales. We take care of licensing with BMI & ASCAP as well,
    as long as the artists pay their dues.</li>

      <li>Only requirement to get "signed" is to register the  name you
    publish your art under as an LLC, creating mutual benefits: artists
    get more control over their profits and intellectual property while
    we get to simplify our payments structure and keep track of their
    accounts through an EIN rather than an IP for data security. Also
    eliminates fake accounts and duplicate accounts.</li>

      <li>Artists can use their pages to announce events and  sell tickets as
    well as physical presses of albums and merchandise that can be
    done.</li>

      <li>Special subscription-based account types for visual artists,
    venues, producers and managers looking for clients or bookings to
    allow us to efficiently network talent by actively connecting the
    best matches based on common interest algorithms.</li>
      <h6>The Music market is worth 43Bn annually at 29.3%*</h6>
    </ul>

    <h3>IP Licensing:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Division of the company set up to distribute the work of the
    software division and to form partnerships/client accounts for
    custom development.</li>
      <li>Fields HR relations.</li>
      <li>Handles legal work.</li>
      <li>Manages and analyzes company-owned data.</li>
      <li>Controls Advertiser Relations program.</li>
      <h6>The software licensing/contract development market is worth
448BN at 8.8% CAGR*</h6>
      <h6>The online advertising/data market is worth 33Bn at 19% CAGR*</h6>
    </ul>


    <h3>Brick and Mortar Franchises:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes advantage of recent theater and venue closures/
    foreclosures (as well as other free or low-cost real estate
    opportunities) to purchase old stages/screens to restore or
    remodel them into cutting-edge 4D capable venues for movies,
    concerts, plays and other events with a record store selling
    Mobius-distributed tickets, records and merchandise.</li>

      <li>Having a wide range of events means we can be staging them and selling
    tickets all-day every day, thus bringing people into the stores to
    buy locally sourced food and entertainment memorabilia on a
    consistent basis. More than just a business, it is a community.</li>

      <li>Partners with EEG Enterprises' real estate division and our
    franchise owners to purchase the spaces and pay for renovations.
    </li>

      <li>Stock of pre-made recipes, prep instructions, etc. to run several
    types of concessions stands including organic cafe, coffee/soda
    bar and the standby snack foods supplemented by unique yet
    inexpensive-to-stock options such as BBQ crickets. All foodservice
    enterprises focus on maximizing profit to cost ratio while
    maintaining conscious sourcing and nutrition practices.</li>

      <li>The Live Music market is responsible for driving most of the
	growth of the current music industry that is worth 43Bn as
	mentioned above.</li>
