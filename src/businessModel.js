  <h1>MOBIUS BUSINESS MODEL</h1>
  <form>
    Current Partners: 4D Sound, Trinet, EEG Enterprises

Needed Partners: Audio Manufacturing, Software Engineers,
Lawyers, Licensing Specialists, foodservice supply personnel,
Record Press, Merchandise manufacture & dropshipping,
warehousing, distribution channels

<h3>Importance of Diversified Model:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The multi-faceted approach favored by our enterprise exists to
promote versatility and to create a dedicated user base. The model
we like to use as an example is Elon Musk's TESLA. They own their
core technology, their complementary technologies and their
distribution outlets. This allows them to create a cycle of internal
demand as well as to work closely together to develop a truly
integrated experience for users and clients alike.</li>

      <li>Our model is very similar. The record label exists primarily to
generate demand for Mobius DAW, Mobius Pro Audio Devices and
Mobius Consumer Audio Devices, thus giving us control over our
primary technology and most of the complementary technologies
that support the production of 4D content. This in turn drives up the
demand for our products as we support the expansion of our user
base rather than relying on the ecosystem at large.</li>

      <li>As we gain more users, the more demand there will be for our IP Licensing services as
companies will want their devices capable of streaming 4D Audio out
of the box.</li>

      <li>The brick and mortar stores provide an easy way to expand the
distribution networks of both physical products and website content,
freeing us from relying on other people's outlets on an exclusive
basis.</li>

      <li>We make use of all of our publicity efforts as money making
tools in and of themselves. It makes no sense to spend money
advertising in the entertainment business when you can generate
awareness and revenue simultaneously through events-based
outreach programs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Advantages of Collectivized Model:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplified Tax and Benefits structure. When C-suite and floor
    employees are on the same benefits package as well as the same
    pay forms you no longer have to deal with expensive W-2 or 1099
    wage claim forms opting instead to pay everyone with biweekly
    dividends.</li>
      <li>Simplifies hiring and firing by having one set of paperwork for ALL
    of ownership and payroll.</li>
      <li>Quickly raise further cash by selling Class-B stock on the startup
    stock exchange or eventually NYSE/NASDAQ while maintaining
    employee control over enterprise.</li>
      <li>Workers are motivated to work their way up within an enterprise
    that pays them a living salary and promotes from within, increasing
    productivity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ownership Structure:</h3>
    <p>Currently Carter Pochynok owns 100% of PSL, however 80%
ownership is being transferred to EEG Enterprises prior to assessing
equity to investors/partners. Currently, Carter Pochynok is set to
keep 20% equity and 4D Sound will be assessed 15% equity upon
the completion of partnership agreement. EEG Enterprises will then
split the remaining equity into 20%, 10% and 35% stakes. The 35%
stake will be used to employ workers for the company via an
employee's union that elects one representative to sit on the C-suite
board yearly. The 20% stake is available to be purchased by an
investor, while the remaining 10% is to be held by EEG Enterprises.</p>
